/**
 * `cumora agent computer` — the BYOA daemon.
 *
 * A long-running process on the user's machine (laptop or VPS) that hosts one
 * or more of their Cumora agents, using a local engine (Claude Code / Codex)
 * as each agent's brain. See docs/en/BYOA.md.
 *
 * It talks to the Cumora server only over HTTP — no DB/Redis — so it can run
 * anywhere:
 *   - pair once:   cumora agent computer --pair <code> [--server <url>]
 *   - then run:    cumora agent computer [--server <url>]
 *
 * Per managed agent it: mints a short-lived runtime JWT, holds a wake-stream
 * SSE connection, and on each wake spawns the engine in the agent's isolated
 * home (~/.cumora/agents/<id>/). The engine acts on Cumora via a `cumora`
 * shim the daemon writes onto its PATH (which POSTs to /runtime/cli).
 *
 * Standalone: only Node builtins + the DB-free SSE parser + engine.ts.
