# Release Manual

How to cut a new desktop release of Cumora.

## TL;DR

```bash
# 1. Bump the version in package.json
npm version patch       # → 0.1.0 → 0.1.1   (creates the tag locally)

# 2. Push the tag — GitHub Actions does the rest
git push origin main --tags
```

The push to a `v*` tag fires the desktop release workflow:

- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** in this repo → dispatches to
  `yetone/cumora-releases`, which builds + signs + publishes the
  Electron app for macOS (arm64 + Intel), Windows, and Linux. Final
  artifacts land at https://github.com/yetone/cumora-releases/releases.

It does **not** deploy the API server. Backend production deploys are an
explicit, separately approved action; a desktop tag must never silently mutate
the backend.

The auto-updater in the desktop app reads from `cumora-releases`, so
once the release workflow finishes (~15–20 minutes), running clients
will pick it up on their next periodic update check.

## Backend release: build candidate, then ignite production

Every push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/build.yml`. Before publishing an
image it must pass both TypeScript projects, the big-brain and tracked-LLM
guards, unit tests, and the Postgres/Redis integration suite. A successful run
produces immutable SHA-tagged server (and, when affected, agent-computer)
images. It does not deploy them.

To deploy a candidate:

1. Open **Actions → Deploy → Run workflow**.
2. Enter the exact short SHA tag produced by Build. Avoid `latest` when a SHA
   is available; Deploy resolves either tag to a digest before touching GKE.
3. Set `include_agent=Y` when the build changed `server/src/agents/**`, the
   bundled CLI/runtime, or the agent-computer image. Otherwise use `N`.
4. Approve the protected `production` environment. The approver should not be
   the person who built the feature for high-risk changes.
5. Verify the workflow summary contains the selected digest, previous server
   image, completed rollout, and passed authenticated smoke.

Deploy first proves that the existing production API and smoke credential are
healthy, records the current revision as the rollback baseline, updates the
server/init-container (and optionally agent runtime) by digest, waits for GKE,
then exercises real authenticated tenant paths: auth, conversations, and the
Shipping overview/schema. A failed post-deploy smoke automatically runs
`kubectl rollout undo`, waits for the old revision to become ready, and fails
the workflow.

Shipping features additionally track a production readback deadline, default
24 hours after a successful release. The Ship workspace surfaces due items;
the server turns missed deadlines into `overdue` release state plus high
severity friction. `.github/workflows/production-readback.yml` independently
checks authenticated production paths each day. A feature only reaches
`Learned` after its production release has explicit readback evidence and no
failing regression asset.

### Required backend secrets and environment protection

On `yetone/cumora`:

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `GCP_WIF_PROVIDER` | Workload Identity Federation provider used to resolve and deploy images. |
| `GCP_DEPLOY_SA` | Least-privilege service account for Artifact Registry and the production GKE deployment. |
| `CUMORA_SMOKE_TOKEN` | Dedicated, revocable session/service token used only for authenticated smoke/readback. |
| `CUMORA_SMOKE_COMPANY_ID` | Non-sensitive tenant id that the smoke identity belongs to. |

Protect the `production` GitHub environment with required reviewers. Put the
smoke secrets in both `production` and `production-readback` (or configure the
latter to inherit repository secrets). Rotate the smoke token like any other
production credential and never print it in workflow output.

## What the release workflow does

1. Matrix-builds the Electron app on four runners (macOS arm64,
   macOS Intel, Windows, Linux).
2. On macOS, imports the Developer ID cert into a temporary keychain,
   signs the app bundle, and notarises via the Apple credentials in
   GitHub Secrets.
3. Uploads platform-specific artifacts (DMG, ZIP, EXE, AppImage, DEB,
   `latest*.yml` autoupdate feeds, blockmaps).
4. Merges the per-arch `latest-mac.yml` files so one feed advertises
   both arm64 and Intel.
5. Generates a user-friendly changelog via the OpenAI API from the
   commit list between the previous tag and this one.
6. Mirrors everything to the `cumora-updates` Cloudflare R2 bucket
   (only when R2 secrets are configured — optional).
7. Creates the GitHub Release with the artifacts attached and the
   generated changelog as the body.
8. Posts an announcement to the Discord release channel (only when the
   webhook is configured — optional).

## One-time setup (already done; reference only)

### Required GitHub Secrets

On `yetone/cumora`:

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `RELEASES_REPO_TOKEN` | Fine-grained PAT scoped to `yetone/cumora-releases`. Needs `Actions: write`. |

On `yetone/cumora-releases`:

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CUMORA_REPO_TOKEN`             | Fine-grained PAT scoped to `yetone/cumora`. Needs `Contents: read`. |
| `MAC_CERTIFICATE_P12`           | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application cert (`.p12`). `base64 -i Certificates.p12 \| pbcopy`. |
| `MAC_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`      | Password protecting the `.p12` above. |
| `APPLE_ID`                      | Apple Developer account email. |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`   | App-specific password for notarisation. Generated at appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords. |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`                 | 10-char Team ID from developer.apple.com → Account → Membership. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                | Used to generate the changelog. |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`              | (optional) R2 mirror for the `cumora-updates` bucket. |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`          | (optional) R2 mirror credential. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`         | (optional) R2 endpoint scope. |
| `DISCORD_RELEASE_WEBHOOK_URL`   | (optional) Discord channel webhook for release announcements. |

If any of the optional secrets are unset, the workflow skips that step
and still succeeds.

### One-time Cumora-side wiring

- `build.publish` in `package.json` points at `yetone/cumora-releases`,
  so the in-app auto-updater knows where to look.
- `build.mac.notarize.teamId` reads `APPLE_TEAM_ID` from the workflow
  environment.
- `build/entitlements.mac.plist` declares the hardened-runtime
  entitlements Electron needs (JIT, network access, dyld vars).

## Manual rebuild of a past release

If a previous release needs a re-roll (signing failed, missing artifact,
etc.), use the `workflow_dispatch` form on `yetone/cumora-releases`:

1. Go to https://github.com/yetone/cumora-releases/actions/workflows/release.yml
2. **Run workflow** → enter:
   - `ref` = the tag from this repo (e.g. `v0.1.0`)
   - `version` = the bare version (e.g. `0.1.0`)
3. The workflow re-builds and overwrites the existing release artifacts.

## Common issues

- **macOS notarisation fails.** Most commonly `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
  was rotated or the cert is expired. Check
  `https://appleid.apple.com` and `Keychain Access` on a Mac with the
  cert installed.
- **Build runs but no GitHub Release is created.** The publish job
  requires `permissions: contents: write` which is already set in the
  workflow. If you forked the repos, make sure that permission is also
  granted on your fork.
- **`latest-mac.yml` mentions only one architecture.** One of the two
  Mac runners failed before producing the yml. Look at the `Upload
  build artifacts` step on `build-mac-arm64` / `build-mac-x64`.
- **The desktop app doesn't see the update.** The autoupdater polls
  every 10 minutes (default for `electron-builder`). Force it from the
  app menu or restart.
